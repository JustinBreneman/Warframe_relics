# WarframeRelics

Welcome to the Warframe Relic gem. This gem will provide access to a current list of relics, sorted into vaulted and available, through a CLI. You can also use this gem to access the drop tables for each relic.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'Warframe_relics'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install Warframe_relics

## Usage

At any time while this program is running, type 'exit' and it will stop.

Once prompted, type in either a list name, or a relic name.

The list names are 'available', 'vaulted', or 'all'.

All relic names must be entered with the era, then the type.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
